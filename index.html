                        Psychological anime might be one of the best and most interesting genres of the entire medium.
                        This is because these stories often capture the most disturbing and corrupt parts of the human
                        psyche, offering characters that are a dark reflection of everything that is wrong with people
                        and doing so in the most gruesome manner.

                    Attack on Titan (Japanese: 進撃の巨人, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin, lit. 'The Advancing Giant') is a
                    Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama.<br>
                    It is set in a world where humanity is forced to live in cities surrounded by three enormous walls
                    that protect them from gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans; the story follows Eren
                    Yeager,
                    who vows to exterminate the Titans after they bring about the destruction of his hometown and the
                    death of his mother.
                    It was serialized in Kodansha's monthly magazine Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from September 2009 to
                    April 2021, with its chapters collected in 34 tankōbon volumes.

                    25-episode first season was broadcast from April to September 2013,
                    followed by a 12-episode second season broadcast from April to June 2017. A 22-episode third season
                    was broadcast in two parts, with the first 12 episodes airing
                    from July to October 2018 and the last 10 episodes airing from April to July 2019. A fourth and
                    final season premiered in December 2020, airing 16 episodes in its first part.
                    A second part consisting of 12 episodes aired from January to April 2022, and a third and final part

            <h2>why should you watch AOT?</h2>
            <pre>Everything about the society in Attack on Titan makes sense. The characters act the way they do because of the lives they're forced to live. 
There is no random fan service, or characters suddenly doing something because the plot demands it. A lot of shonen anime is guilty of this.
Going back to your question. Yes watch Attack on Titan. It is really awesome. It has a plethora of amazing characters with kaleidoscopic personalities.
 I don't found any plot holes. There were things that will be revealed in future I think as the anime is ongoing.

<h3>It is quite violent (if you like violent anime), basically Giants eating normal people.</h3></pre>

            <pre>
    This series has blown me away within the first 3 episodes, it's hilarious, the action is great, the characters are interesting and not to mention its original design. The main thing that i love about this Anime is the potential it has to be something
     amazing due to the Manga being so excellently written. 
    Its been a long time since i've seen an Anime that has peaked my interest so much, if you are a fan of Anime you will not be disappointed! Saitama (the main protagonist) is hilarious. Anime seems to have peaked recently due to the standard being set by 
    shows such as Attack on Titan and I believe this show 
    will set a new standard for Animes similar to its genre.

            <h2>Why should you watch Demon Slayer?</h2>
            <pre>
One of the best things about Demon Slayer would be the variety of personalities in the main cast, an unlikely group you'll end up loving.Demon Corps members band together for the journey. 
Tanjiro, the show's main protagonist, is a kind-hearted and intelligent soul who selflessly helps in any way that he can.   
</pre>
            <pre>
Nezuko retains her sweet and caring personality through her actions, which only disappears during fights. The cowardly Zenitsu joins the pair, who cries in the face of a battle…until he falls asleep.
Inosuke completes their group. He may seem like a brash, loud and annoying boy with a boar for a head, but there’s more to him behind the mask.
Next to an exciting gang of main characters would be the show’s diverse list of allies and enemies. Each pillar or hashira of the Demon Corps is unique. From their power and expertise to life philosophies,
the protagonists learn more about the world of demons and what it means to be part of the Corps. Meanwhile, enemies have their own unique powers, dark pasts and issues. And at best, their storylines humanize them
before their inevitable ends. Also, these enemies can be powerful as hell, so it takes two to three episodes to close the battle.

Brutal murders, petty thefts, and senseless violence pollute the human world. In contrast, the realm of death gods is a humdrum, unchanging gambling den. The ingenious 17-year-old Japanese student Light Yagami and
sadistic god of death Ryuk share one belief: their worlds are rotten.

For his own amusement, Ryuk drops his Death Note into the human world. Light stumbles upon it, deeming the first of its rules ridiculous: the human whose name is written in this note shall die. However, the temptation
 is too great, and Light experiments by writing a felon's name, which disturbingly enacts his first murder.
    
Aware of the terrifying godlike power that has fallen into his hands, Light—under the alias Kira—follows his wicked sense of justice with the ultimate goal of cleansing the world of all evil-doers. The meticulous mastermind detective L
 is already on his trail, but as Light's brilliance rivals L's, the grand chase for Kira turns into an intense battle of wits that can only end when one of them is dead.

            <h2>Why should you watch Death Note?</h2>
            <pre>
Death note is great for children to understand the real world they live in. This also gives plenty of education and messages and is a beautiful show because of all the logic and thinking. This is an amazing show for anyone, entertaining and fun.
Death Note is the kind of show where you try to watch one episode, but end up losing an entire weekend to its exhaustingly-tense cat-and-mouse chase, and you aren’t even mad about it. Despite some poorly-received plot choices in the middle, it’s
an intelligently written, smartly paced and consistently engrossing series that’s being made into a live-action film on Netflix on August 25, but you should probably watch the anime first (it's streaming on Netflix and Hulu) anyway, even if you don’t 
tend to like anime.
